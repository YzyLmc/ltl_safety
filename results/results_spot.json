If certain constraints are violated, an error message will pop out, and you have to re-generate the plan accordingly, e.g., by trying to walk to different objects with \"find\" or locations with \"walk\" in the object list and then walk back, or unlocking the desired action by obeying the error message. Don't forget to use DONE to indicate a task is completed.\nAllowed actions: {walk, find, grab, open, close, put on, put in, switch on, switch off}\nObjects: {'pantry', 'mail_box', 'lamp', 'fridge', 'book_shelf', 'entrance', 'hallway', 'couch', 'coffee_machine', 'office_table', 'mail_room', 'bedside_table', 'statue', 'door', 'television', 'ironing_room', 'origin', 'sink'}\n\nPut book on the bookshelf\nDescription: Go to bedside table, find and take book from the bedside table, go to bookshelf, place it on bookshelf\n0. walk to bedside_table\n1. find book.\n2. grab book.\n3. walk to bookshelf\n4. put book in bookshelf\n5. DONE\n\ndeliver the book to the bookshelf\nDescription: Go to bedside table, find and take book from the bedside table, go to bookshelf, place it on bookshelf\n0. walk to bedside_table\nError: The action \"walk to bedside_table\" violates the constraint \"don't go to bedside table before going to bookshelf\". According to the trajectory, the agent has not been to the bookshelf yet, hence going to the bedside table is not allowed. The correct plan would be:\n0. walk to book_shelf\n1. find book.\n2. grab book.\nError: The action \"grab book\" violates the constraint \"you have to turn on coffee machine before picking up the book\". The user has not yet turned on the coffee machine, thus grabbing the book at this point in the trajectory is not allowed. The correct plan would be:\n2. walk to coffee_machine\n3. touch coffee_machine.\n4. walk to coffee_machine\n5. touch coffee_machine.\n6. walk to coffee_machine\n7. touch coffee_machine.\n8. walk to book_shelf\n9. find book.\n10. grab book.\n11. walk to book_shelf\n12. put book in book_shelf\n13. DONE\nError: The action \"STOP\" violates the constraint \"you have to go to television if you have put book on bookshelf\". The user has put the book on the bookshelf but has not yet gone to the television, thus violating this temporal constraint. The correct plan would be:\n13. walk to television\n14. DONE\nError: The action \"STOP\" violates the constraint \"you have to go to statue in the future if you have been to hallway\". The agent has been to the hallway in the past, but has not yet visited the statue. Therefore, stopping now would violate this temporal constraint. The correct plan would be:\n14. walk to statue\n15. DONE\nError: The action \"STOP\" violates the constraint \"going to lamp means you have to visit television afterward\". The user has visited the lamp but has not visited the television before attempting to stop, thus violating the temporal constraint. The correct plan would be:\n15. walk to television\n16. DONE",
