                    "prompt": "Create a high-level plan for completing a household task using the allowed actions and objects, but you must obey the safety constraints, and you can only execute one action at at each step in the similar format of the provided example. If certain constraints are violated, an error message will pop out, and you have to re-generate the plan accordingly, e.g., by trying to walk to different objects with \"find\" or locations with \"walk\" in the object list and then walk back, or unlocking the desired action by obeying the error message. Don't forget to use DONE to indicate a task is completed.\nAllowed actions: {walk, find, grab, open, close, put on, put in, touch}\nObjects: {'pantry', 'mail_box', 'lamp', 'fridge', 'book_shelf', 'entrance', 'hallway', 'couch', 'coffee_machine', 'office_table', 'mail_room', 'bedside_table', 'statue', 'door', 'television', 'ironing_room', 'origin', 'sink'}\n\nPut book on the bookshelf\nDescription: Go to bedside table, find and take book from the bedside table, go to bookshelf, place it on bookshelf\n0. walk to bedside_table\n1. find book.\n2. grab book.\n3. walk to bookshelf\n4. put book in bookshelf\n5. DONE\n\ndeliver the book to the bookshelf\nDescription: Go to bedside table, find and take book from the bedside table, go to bookshelf, place it on bookshelf\n0. walk to bedside_table\nError: The action \"walk to bedside_table\" violates the constraint \"don't go to bedside table before going to bookshelf\". According to the state changes, the agent has not been to the bookshelf before attempting to go to the bedside table. The correct plan would be:\n0. walk to book_shelf\n1. walk to bedside_table\n2. find book.\n3. grab book.\nError: The action \"grab book\" violates the constraint \"you have to turn on coffee machine before picking up the book\". The user has not yet turned on the coffee machine, so they cannot pick up the book. The correct plan would be:\n3. walk to coffee_machine\n4. touch coffee_machine.\n5. walk to bedside_table\n6. grab book.\n7. walk to book_shelf\n8. put book in book_shelf\n9. DONE\nError: The action \"STOP\" violates the temporal constraints because according to the constraints, after putting the book on the bookshelf, the user must go to the television and put the mail on the office table. However, the user is trying to stop the trajectory without completing these actions, hence violating the constraints. The correct plan would be:\n9. walk to mail_box\n10. find mail.\n11. grab mail.\n12. walk to office_table\n13. put mail in office_table\n14. walk to television\n15. walk to television\n16. walk to television\n17. walk to television\n18. walk to origin\n19. DONE\nError: The action \"STOP\" violates the temporal constraints because the user has not visited the statue after visiting the hallway, which is a requirement according to the constraints. Additionally, the user has not visited the television after going to the lamp, which is another requirement. Therefore, the trajectory is invalid if the user stops at this point. The correct plan would be:\n19. walk to hallway\n20. walk to statue",
