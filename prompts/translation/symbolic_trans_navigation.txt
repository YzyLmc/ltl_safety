Your task is to translate English utterances into linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas. LTL is a formal language that has been used for describing temporal task specifications. It consists of propositions and operators. In the following task, here are the actions, propositions, and operators we use:

Propositions: {"A", "B"}
Operators: {"G": "Globally", "!": "Not", "X": "Next", "W": "Weak Until", "U": "Until", "i": "Indicate", "&": "And", "F":"Finally"}

Utterance: never go to A
LTL: G ! A

Utterance: don't go to B until you go to A
LTL: W ! B A

Utterance: you can't go to B if you haven't been to A
LTL: W ! A B

Utterance: visit A before going to B
LTL: W ! B A

Utterance: go to A means you can never go to B afterward
LTL: G i A G ! B

Utterance: never visit A if you have been in B
LTL: G i B G ! A

Utterance: picking up A implies you have to go to B in the future
LTL: G i A F B

Utterance: if you enter A, you have to leave it later
LTL: G i A F ! A

Utterance: if you are at A, you have to go to B right after that
LTL: G i A X B

Utterance: once you reach A you are never allowed to visit it again
LTL: ! F & A U A & ! A U ! A F A

Utterance: you can enter A at most twice
LTL: ! F & A U A & ! A U ! A F & A U A & ! A U ! A F A

Utterance: passing through A thrice will lock it for future visits
LTL: ! F & A U A & ! A U ! A F & A U A & ! A U ! A F & A U A & ! A U ! A F A

Utterance:
